This is a group project based on Machine Learning which uses two CNN's namely XGBoost and LightGBM
We uesd Imageprocessor for feature extracion and we used extracted features for training the models
We used HAM10000 as the dataset for feature extraction
The models have an accuracy of 74.34%(XGBoost) and 72.39%(LightGBM)
After each model predicts and gives result we use DecisionFusion to give the final result
